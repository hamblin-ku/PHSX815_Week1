# PHSX815_Week1
This is a practice README.md for PHSX 815.

## Homework 2
For HW2 I added onto the existing code, by adding a commnad line argument allowing for the random numbers to be read from a file. For example:

python PHSX815_HW2_KurtH.py -r random_numbers.txt.

Will read the random numbers from the file 'random_numbers.txt' (which was generated using the Random Class in the provided code). The file 'my_params.py' contains a basic outline of the matplotlib parameters I like to use for my plots.
